                    <p>
                        Margaret Harris is the owner of Blue Monkey Tea, tea & gourmet 
                        food store in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As one of Pittsburgh's 
                        primary tea experts, Margaret Harris is a tea consultant and 
                        regularly conducts classes and workshops on tea at a variety of 
                        venues, including colleges, clubs, associations, corporations, 
                        and at her store. As a native of Poland, where tea is the primary 
                        household beverage, her lifelong experience with tea began quite 
                        early: she may have had her first "cup of tea" when she was only 
                        one day old! Margaret is a graduate of the Warsaw Medical College, 
                        which has enabled her to incorporate her medical knowledge into 
                        her teachings on the health aspects of teas and tisanes. Margaret 
                        is a founding member of the Western Pennsylvania Tea Business 
                        Association, as well as several other business and professional 
                        groups. 

                        Blue Monkey Tea was called Margaret's Fine Imports and 
                        before that Wicks and Beans.

                    <h3>How We Have Changed Over Time</h3>
                    <!-- Unordered list of history -->
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The original store was established in May of 2002. It was 
                            named Wicks & Beans, as the original merchandise consisted 
                            mostly of scented candles and coffee beans. We were located 
                            at 2207 Murray Ave, also in Squirrel Hill (down and across 
                            from Mineo's Pizza.)<br/><br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Despite the small space, we expanded our assortments, 
                            eventually also selling teas and international sweets. Well, 
                            it was getting tight, so we were very happy to move to a much 
                            larger space at 5872 Forbes Ave in July of 2006 and change 
                            the name of the store to Margaret's Fine Imports.<br/><br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Since then we've become mostly a Tea Specialty store with 
                            over 400 varieties of teas in stock, and a huge assortment 
                            of teapots and tea gadgets. We even sell items like tea 
                            cozies and tea wallets!<br/><br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We offer Tea Classes and Tea Tastings every month. We also 
                            carry over 30 types of coffee beans and some neat coffee makers!<br/><br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Apart from that we also attend to the sweet tooth of our 
                            customers by stocking up on international sweets, especially 
                            around Holidays.<br/><br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We offer excellent service and we enjoy interacting with our 
                            customers: repeat and new!<br/><br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On May 9th, 2017 we opened a store in Carnegie and changed 
                            both store names to Blue Monkey Tea. The Carnegie PA location 
                            moved to Pittsburgh in February of 2019.<br/><br/>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whose a good Blue Monkey Tea? We are a good Blue Monkey Tea! 
                            And we are here to serve you! We changed our name, in an 
                            attempt, to brand ourselves nationwide.<br/>
